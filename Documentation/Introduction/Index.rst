Demander is a configurable, demand-based filtering framework with
permalink-support for TYPO3.

Generic filtering and ordering
------------------------------

Filter and order records from different sources and in different plugins on the
same page using generic filtering criteria.

**Example:** apply the same category or freetext search filter to both news
records and content elements.

Configure UI components
-----------------------

You can also supply configuration for filtering and ordering-related UI
components, such as text fields, drop-downs, checkbox lists, and sliders. The
Demander extension can provide information about available and currently
selected options.

.. info::

   The plan is to supply ready-to-use JavaScript components with this extension,
   but they have not yet been implemented.
